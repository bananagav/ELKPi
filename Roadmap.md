Roadmap for my Homelab SIEM

This is entirely a work in progress, but I think some items I plan to have done are...


1. Setting up a switch at home and making a dedicated location for the SIEM (Basement)
2. Getting my RazPi on an SSD instead of the microSD/Adding storage
3. Adding more agents on endpoints around the house
4. Port Mirroring on my router to set up log collection from my router. 

All of the Above are for the Physical upgrades I would like... 

For Things I would like to learn, 

1. Understand Cases, how to build a case and investigate using Kibana. 
2. Either Import or Create a Custom Dashboard to use.
3. Create some rules to use for our network. 
4. Understand the Elastic Endpoint protections and capabilities
5. Learn about EQL and learn how to Threat Hunt on my Network. 

And most of all - Properly document all of this.

Might start making videos on this as well - TBD
