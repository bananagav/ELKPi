# ELKPi
ELK Stack on Raspberry Pi 4 8GB Homelab project

For this project, I'm creating an ELK Instance on a Raspberry Pi 4 as a home SIEM to monitor my network, endpoints, and network traffic. 

The Intent is for me to be able to monitor and defend the endpoints on my network, including the few desktops we have, my personal PC, and my Personal laptop.
