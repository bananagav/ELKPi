An Update

I've purchased and installed an unmanaged switch, and now my SIEM is connected to ethernet. 

Though since getting this connected I've had trouble getting things to connect, I believe the Pi changed some of 
it's networking settings when I got the ethernet connected, so I'm gonna begin the process to get my networking 
settled in and together. One of the things I need to do is set my SIEM to a static IP, so we don't run into any 
issue with this in the future


using netplan I've created a configuration file and set a static IP and I'm going to disable the radio wifi so my 
Pi uses the ethernet connection instead of wifi.

using nmcli radio wifi I checked that it was working and then disabled radio wifi

now, using ip addr, my configs show that I'm using ethernet and no longer using wifi, and that the IP is set correctly so my
server is working as I've set it. As of now I'm still able to log into my server, and everything looks like it is connecting
