Now that I have my Agent connected for the time being, I'm starting to get to work on my Defence monitoring and setting up my SIEM. 


11/13/2023

I've added all of the Elastic Rules that they recommend on their security Dashboard, including a lot of them for services I don't use (it was an *add all* button type of thing, and their selection system is pretty weird. 

Regardless, SIEM rules are up, no alerts quite yet which I'm not sure is a good thing, given that I've been SSH'ing, running PowerShell scripts, etc. It'll be interesting to see what comes in from just regular PC use
(Given that the rules and log intake are working correctly)
